Leetcode Solution for problem - 931 - Minimum falling sum (medium)

Approach - Dynamic Programming-memoization- (Bottom-up) Approach
Time complexity-O(n^2)
Space complexity - O(n^2)

Intuition - We have to traverse from second last row to the zeroth row of the given matrix and store the result of each element in the dp matrix.

Suppose we have this matrix
 A11 A12 A12 A14 A15 A16 A17 ....A1N
 A21 A22 A23 A24 A25 A26 A27 ....A2N
